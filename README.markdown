Integrity
=========

[Integrity][] is your friendly automated Continuous Integration server.

Integrity Dummy Notifier
========================

This is a dummy Integrity notifier that does not do anything but registering itself with the Integrity server. Its only purpose is being used as a starting point for creating more complex and useful notifiers.

Setup Instructions
==================

Just install this gem via `sudo gem install matflores-integrity-dummy` and then in your
Rackup (ie, `config.ru`) file:

    require "rubygems"
    require "integrity/notifier/dummy"

Notice that the only thing this notifier will do is to write a message to Integrity's log file whenever it gets called.
